<div align="justify" style="position:absolute; width:430px; left: 7px; top: 3px"><b>M u l t i m e d i a</b> /manga.html?<br><br>You may or may not have noticed that there are no manga images throughout this site. This is due to respect for the mangaka, CLAMP, who has requested fans to refrain from using their images online. The request can be found in English at their official site, <a href="http://clamp-net.com" target="_blank">clamp-netCOM</a> (in the Attention paragraph, click the only link, in Japanese and scroll to the very bottom). Many do not abide by CLAMP's image policies, as they believe this exposure will only bring in more profit for CLAMP. However, no matter what the argument is, CLAMP's policies are still in effect, and I feel the need to respect their wishes. Thus, if you are looking for manga images of Hinoto, please look elsewhere. Thank you for your kind attention. :3
